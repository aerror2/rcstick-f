rcstick-f
====

rcstick-f is a USB HID device which has 8 analog axis.
And this device is also a RF receiver which conplient with Futaba S-FHSS protocol.<br>
This device is designed to be used to controll RC flight simulator by Futaba RC transmitter.

[This product](https://www.google.com/search?q=WS1000+Spektrum&rlz=1C5CHFA_enJP742JP742&oq=WS1000+Spektrum&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.14185j0j8&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) is almost same with rcstick-f except supported protocol. I could'nt find a such kind of device supported Futaba RC protocol.<br>
That's why I determined toã€€start this project.

## Project Status
The PoC has been done in [this project](https://github.com/opiopan/sfhss-study).<br>
Now I'm in PCB design phase. It's almost done. However I'm not satisfied. A connector for debugger is too big. I'm finding smaller one.
